Sentiment Analysis
Using the Afinn package, the sentiment score for each review is calculated. This package assigns a sentiment score to individual words in the review text, which is then aggregated to determine the overall sentiment of each review.

1. Positive Sentiment: Reviews with a high positive score.
2. Negative Sentiment: Reviews with a low or negative score.
3. Neutral Sentiment: Reviews that do not strongly lean towards positive or negative.
